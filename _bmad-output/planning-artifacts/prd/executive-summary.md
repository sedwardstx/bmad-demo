# Executive Summary

bmad-demo is a self-hosted personal bookmark management tool that replaces chaotic browser bookmarks with fast capture, structured organization, and frictionless sharing. Built on FastAPI + SQLite with a simple HTML front-end and a Chromium/Edge browser extension, it targets anyone with diverse interests who saves web content for later reference — and consistently fails to find it again.

The core problem: browser bookmarks were designed for navigation shortcuts, not knowledge management. They auto-generate cryptic titles, offer no tagging, and bury links in flat folder hierarchies that become unsearchable graveyards. bmad-demo solves this with a purpose-built UX for saving, categorizing, and retrieving links — plus the ability to curate and share link collections as clean public HTML pages requiring zero setup from recipients.

Single-user, self-hosted, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in. Clone it, run it, own your data.

### What Makes This Special

Three capabilities that no single existing tool combines well:

1. **Speed of capture** — Browser extension auto-fills the page title, lets you pick an interest category and add tags, and saves in under 5 seconds without leaving the page
2. **Hierarchical organization with dual tagging** — Interest areas with optional subcategories provide structure; freeform tags provide flexibility. Both are searchable and filterable.
3. **Zero-friction shareable lists** — Curate a collection, generate a public URL, send it to a friend. They click and see a clean HTML page. No sign-up, no install, no app required.

The core insight: saving a link "for later" is a different activity than navigating to a favorite site. It deserves its own tool — one built around retrieval, not repetition.
